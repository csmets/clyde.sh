I am a software engineer at Expedia with interests in web technologies and the
internet. I hope to one day be able to expose and write about a
[zero day](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/what-is-a-zero-day/), but in
the mean time I will write about interesting things I've came across or that
I've worked on.
